Hello! 👋 I’m Katelyn Bryner. A designer-developer hybrid working to make the user central to everything I do.

An early memory is of my father sitting beside me at the computer. He opened a text editor and started to outline a basic coding structure for a website. He taught me about HTML and CSS and let me run wild to explore the possibilities. I was 14 years old.
⏩ Fast forward to how it played out:
⟶ Professionally trained visual designer and design strategist.
⟶ Learned the ropes working full time throughout an early-college program in high school.
⟶ Completed college at 19, becoming an expert in UX design, strategy, & innovative acceleration.
⟶ Journeyed into larger design projects where I designed, developed & managed creative assets.
⟶ Moved design projects from concept to development at many businesses in a variety of industries.

📅 Which brings us to today:
⟶ Working with amazing individuals, team leaders and scrum teams as a Mid-level UI/UX Designer.

I do my best work when I’m exploring new and disparate ideas, designing across disciplines, and furthering my knowledge in the industry. I am a strong advocate and practitioner of human-centered and socially responsible design. Entrepreneurial in spirit and collaborative by nature I have an equally creative and analytical mind and a passion for tackling complex challenges that lead to positive change. I’m recognized as a fearless, happy, and curious designer of business-led solutions.

What I do isn’t a job to me, per se. Rather, it’s a fundamental part of who I am and how I live my life. My journey is to explore and enjoy life in many facets. I will forever be a student of life. Design thinking is in my DNA.

In my spare time? (What is that, spare time!)…

I cook, I sketch, I have a love for commercials like no other and I’m happily living with my boyfriend in small Montana town, enjoy good eatin’ and a great Mimosa now and then.

Oh yeah, I’m an iced mocha snob, hit me up and we’ll virtually grab a cup!
